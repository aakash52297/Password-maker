# Password-maker
The assignment given to us for this week was to build a random password generator focusing on the skills we learned throughout the week. Using all the skills we learned throughout the week and combining what I learned from our weeks with html and css I was able to get the random password generator to work. I started off by building the html first and adding a container with multiple other elements then moved into the css aspect to design it the way I felt would look best. During the css part I used different color combinations and various designs to get the final product of how the random password generator should look.

Within the html I structured everything to be as neat as possible and able to read for others if need be. I focused on the material I have learrned so far to create a proper structure for the html.

Moving onto the css it took me a while to get what I truly wanted, such as colors and font sizes, along with many more details. However, after I went through various selections, I was able to find and use everything that I wanted to design the webpage and randoom password generator to my liking.
